		<h1 style="margin-left:5%">About Me</h1>
		<p style="margin-left:5%">Hello!!! My name is Ethan and I attend UW-Madison. This year, I am attending my 2nd year, and I am studying Information Sciences. I was born in Milwaukee Wisconsin and lived there my whole life. I like to play video games but most of them are fps based. I also like to read graphic novels like Manhua/Manhwa and the like. When I was a kid, I watched a lot of anime but now I am only watching around 2 anime: Solo-Leveling and Ninja Kamui. I am also a part of the UW-Madison Esports club and I usually play Overwatch 2 or League of Legends</p>

		<h1>Why League?</h1>
		<p>My understanding of League of Legends was nonexistent. Only from what I heard from others like the game is trash or I stayed up for days trying to this rank but failed or the game has to many characters. I started playing LoL my freshman year of College because I needed something new. One of my most played games, Valorant, was too long to play with matches ranging from 10 to 40 minutes. So far, I main support because I understand too little about the mechanics. It is fun playing LoL but I see the frustrations others have. </p>
